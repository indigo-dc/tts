# tts
the token translation service (part of the AAI)

requires Erlang OTP 18.1 or newer to run 
(due to a bug in the cover compiler OTP 18.3 or newer is needed to run the tests)

Running the Token Translation Service locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/indigo-dc/tts.git
cd tts
make sample_config
make run 
```
