# Token Translation Service 
## Purpose
The Token Translation Service (TTS) offers an easy way to self service
credentials by users. The TTS was developed as a need when using OpenId Connect
as the only source for authorization and identification. The TTS bridges the gap
between services that do not support OpenId Connect and the OpenId Connect
provider.
