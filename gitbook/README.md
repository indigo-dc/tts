# Token Translation Service 
## Purpose
The Token Translation Service (TTS) offers an easy way to self service
credentials by the users. The TTS was necessary to develop for cases when OpenId
Connect serves as the only source for authorization and identification.
Therefore, the TTS bridges the gap between services that do not support OpenId
Connect and the OpenId Connect provider.
